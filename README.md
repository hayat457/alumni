Konekto - University Communication and Alumni Tracking Platform (Backend API)
🏛️ Architecture and Design Decisions
During the system analysis and design phases, the following key decisions were made for Konekto:

Clean Architecture: Based on the "Separation of Concerns" principle, the project is built on a sustainable and flexible layered structure where dependencies flow from the outside in.
Flexible Data Integration (SIS Readiness): For future official integration with the university's Student Information System (SIS), data access is abstracted via Interfaces; a mock data infrastructure is set up to run until real data is connected.
Database Normalization: Relational integrity is ensured using Entity Framework Core (Code-First); a robust MSSQL schema is designed covering user roles, department details, companies, and employment histories.
🛠️ Tech Stack
The project relies on industry-standard enterprise backend technologies:

Backend:
C# (.NET 8.0) - High-performance and type-safe object-oriented core language
ASP.NET Core Web API - RESTful service architecture
Database & ORM:
MS SQL Server - Relational database management system
Entity Framework Core - Database querying and Code-First modeling
Security & Authorization:
JWT (JSON Web Token) - Secure and role-based access control (Admin, Alumni, Academician)
DevOps & Tools:
Swagger (OpenAPI) - API endpoint documentation and testing
Git & GitHub - Version control and repository management
